# Dynamic Calculation of Network Density in Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANET)

## Abstract

Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) is a network that uses the wireless medium to establish communication between moving vehicles and other network devices. Since VANETs deal with highly mobile vehicles at random speeds, this leads to a dynamic network topology. Due to the dynamic nature of the VANETs, each node tends to enter and leave the surrounding nodeâ€™s transmission range, thus constantly exposing itself. This exposure can lead to consequences such as increased collision and unnecessary waiting times, thus leading to reduced throughput and reliability. This paper proposes a dynamic calculation of network density using existing infrastructure. This approach dynamically adjusts the transmission range based on the vehicle density. Simulations show the relationship between the degree of node being exposed and the dynamic transmission range.

## Introduction

Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) are a subset of Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs) where vehicles act as nodes to create a network. This project addresses the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of VANETs, focusing on the issues of node exposure, collision, and waiting times, which affect the overall throughput and reliability of the network.

## Methodology

The proposed solution involves dynamically calculating the network density using existing infrastructure and adjusting the transmission range based on vehicle density. This dynamic adjustment aims to minimize the exposure of nodes, thereby reducing collisions and waiting times.

## Simulations

Simulations were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic transmission range adjustment. The simulations show the relationship between the degree of node exposure and the dynamically adjusted transmission range.

## Results

The results of the simulations indicate that the dynamic calculation of network density and corresponding transmission range adjustment significantly improve the throughput and reliability of VANETs.

## Conclusion

By dynamically adjusting the transmission range based on vehicle density, the proposed method effectively reduces node exposure, collisions, and waiting times in VANETs, leading to improved network performance.
